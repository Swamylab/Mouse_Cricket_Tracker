# Mouse_Cricket_Tracker
Matlab code that treats experimental footage to track mouse and cricket subjects

this code is intended to take experimental footage of a mouse contained within a confined space and is exposed to a cricket. As behavior progresses, the mouse will reliably hunt the cricket and the code will be ment to track this behavior such that it may be quantified automatically.
